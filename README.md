# CRCI-Experiment-Dataset

This repository contains the experimental dataset and results from our academic study on the **Challenge-Responsive Code Instruction (CRCI)** method for code review effectiveness assessment.
The dataset is directly associated with the experiments described in our paper.

## ðŸ§ª Experimental Context

This dataset was generated from an experimental study involving:
- **9 participants**: 3 undergraduate students, 3 graduate students, and 3 industry professionals  
- **85 code snippets**: drawn from both academic and industrial projects, across Java, C++, C#, and JavaScript  
- **303 injected errors**: balanced distribution of syntax, semantic, and logic errors  
- Reviews conducted under **controlled conditions** (IDE syntax checking disabled, no compilation allowed)  
- Supplementary experiment using **state-of-the-art LLM** for automated review

Full methodology and analysis are described in the associated paper.
